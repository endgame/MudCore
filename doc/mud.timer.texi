@node mud.timer
@section mud.timer

The @code{mud.timer} table holds functions for creating and destroying
timers: lua functions that are set to be called at some point in the
future. Currently, checking for timers to fire is @math{O(n)} in the
number of active timers.

@defun mud.timer.new (@var{delay}, @var{callback})
Register a timer that calls @var{callback} after @var{delay}
seconds. @var{callback} is a function of zero arguments (Lua's semantics
let you close over variables in other scopes, however). Returns a Lua
userdatum with type @code{mudcore.timer}. It is an error to call a
method on an expired timer: as a general rule, a one-shot timer should
arrange the collection of any references to itself.

If the callback returns a positive number, it is used as the new delay
until the timer is called again. Otherwise, the timer is disabled.
@end defun

@defmethod mudcore.timer cancel ()
Cancels a timer.
@end defmethod

@defmethod mudcore.timer remaining ()
Return the number of seconds remaining until the timer fires.
@end defmethod
